	<h3 class="sub-title">True Story by Kevin Nielsen</h3>
	<section>
		<p>I never thought I would learn determination as a young boy at the age of eleven. I was not yet a 
			boy scout, but I was on a Boy Scout trip. I was with my father who was the Scout Master and my 
			older brother who was an Eagle Scout. My brother and I always went on hiking trips with our father 
			and we loved it. This particular trip was a long one. It was a week-long trip visiting four 
			lakes in the beautiful High Sierra. We hiked a series of lakes in which we would spend one-to-two 
			days at a lake fishing, relaxing, and enjoying the wilderness. By the time we got to the last lake, 
			things changed.</p>
		<p>It was at Crystal Lake and we spent half the day hiking to get to this new lake and my tiny little 
			legs were ready to be finished for the day. At the lake, we set up camp but this time we had the 
			lake to ourselves. It was fun picking the best place to put up our tents overlooking the lake 
			surrounded by shade trees. We had privacy so if any more hikers would come to the lake, they 
			would be envious of what we had. All I can say is our camp was perfect.</p>
		<p>As we were enjoying the view, someone noticed a small pillar of smoke far in the distance at the 
			end of the canyon. The leaders felt that we were safe for now, but we should keep an eye on it. 
			The next couple of hours we went fishing. When we returned, we climbed the hill behind camp to 
			check the progress of the fire. We notice a big change in the smoke and it was closer than we expected.</p>
		<p>My Father and the other leaders decided it was time to move. We were asked to take down and pack 
			up camp in five minutes. Normally taking down camp was a drawn-out process. Usually, we dragged 
			our feet and complained of being tired but this time was not the case. I have never seen a tent 
			get packed so fast. There were no complaints, no panic or anxiety, just purpose and focus. I was 
			determined to help to do my part and everyone felt the same. Before we knew it we were ready. 
			Plans were made and a new route was mapped out. The fastest plan was to blaze a trail to meet 
			up with an existing trail on the map. That meant we had to go off-trail and use our skills of 
			navigating the terrain with a compass and topographical map. Our goal was to get us to a neighboring 
			trail that would lead us to the ranger&rsquo;s station and the parking lot next to Devil&rsquo;s 
			Post Pile. It was the shortest path, but it would take us right up to where the fire was coming.</p>
		<p>For me, it was already difficult being the littlest in the group trying to keep the pace with the 
			older boys in the pack. There were switchbacks after switchbacks that seemed to never end and would 
			only get us a little closer each switch. To add to my challenge, the trail was full of little 
			pumice stones that seem to magically find their way into my little shoes. One of the leaders 
			worried that we would never make it because of me. I was constantly stopping to clean out my 
			shoes. I was determined to catch up, so I would walk as far as I could with rocks in my shoes 
			until I couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore. That&rsquo;s when I had to stop and shake out my shoes 
			to give my small feet relief. But it wasn&rsquo;t long and I would repeat this over and over 
			for miles. Looking back I was surprised I didn&rsquo;t cry or curse my situation. I had the 
			determination to keep up with everyone. There was smoke in the treetops at times so it gave 
			us concern. We had a safety plan. If we saw fire we were to alert everyone and head to the 
			river at the base of the canyon where we were hiking above. We never had to use it.</p>
		<p>I was getting tired and the sky was getting grayer. I could see the tiredness in everyone&rsquo;s 
			faces, but that changed when we were greeted by a ranger. Our hike was not over, but the 
			relief came from the ranger&rsquo;s happiness in finding us and how he instructed us that 
			we were almost out. It gave us needed energy and determination. We soon crossed the bridge 
			that leads to the parking lot right across Devil&rsquo;s Post Pile. We were almost there and 
			my tired legs were more than happy about the news. As we got to the end of the trailhead, 
			we were greeted by an army of fireman giving us cheers and pats on our backs. I had a 
			feeling of accomplishment making every step, every rock in my shoes worth it. I had no 
			fear, just one purpose and focus to get to safety.</p>
